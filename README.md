# fplowannierdensity
Calculates interpolated electron densities from FPLO Wannier function outputs as seen in the Supplemental Material of Kaluarachi *et al.*, *Pressure induced half-collapsed-tetragonal phase in CaKFe<sub>4</sub>As<sub>4</sub>* (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06622). 

**Before using this script, please install the Python tricubic interpolation library**, which can be found at https://github.com/danielguterding/pytricubic.

Example input files are located in the As_4pz subfolder. The output generated by the density_from_wf.py script is ready to plot with the splot command in gnuplot.
